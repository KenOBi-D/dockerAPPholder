The base images are defined in several locations across the project:

Backend Base Images (in /backend/compose/):
Django: FROM docker.io/python:3.12.8-slim-bookworm (in compose/local/django/Dockerfile and compose/production/django/Dockerfile)
Postgres: FROM docker.io/postgres:16 (in compose/production/postgres/Dockerfile)
Nginx: FROM docker.io/nginx:1.17.8-alpine (in compose/production/nginx/Dockerfile)
Traefik: FROM docker.io/traefik:3.2.2 (in compose/production/traefik/Dockerfile)
Redis: image: docker.io/redis:6 (referenced in docker-compose.local.yml and docker-compose.production.yml)
Frontend Base Images (in /frontend/):
Node: FROM node:18-alpine (in Dockerfile, used as base image with multiple stages: deps, builder, and runner)
Documentation:
Python: FROM docker.io/python:3.12.8-slim-bookworm (in compose/local/docs/Dockerfile)
These base images are referenced and used in the docker-compose files (docker-compose.local.yml, docker-compose.production.yml, and docker-compose.docs.yml) to build the various services of the application.

fix the images then point to these updated images in the files
